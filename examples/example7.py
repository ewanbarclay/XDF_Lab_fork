# --- In this example we look at the properties of one of the sources identified by segmentation.


import numpy as np
from astropy.io import fits

image_dir = '../data' # define image directory relative to this script

f = 'f125w' # filter

sci = fits.getdata(f'{image_dir}/{f}_sci.fits') # read science FITS file data into numpy array
wht = fits.getdata(f'{image_dir}/{f}_wht.fits') # read weight FITS file data into numpy array

mask = fits.getdata(f'{image_dir}/mask.fits') # read in the image mask
sci = np.ma.masked_array(sci, mask = mask) # apply the mask to our science image
wht = np.ma.masked_array(wht, mask = mask) # apply the mask to our weight image

# --- cut out a portion of the image for analysis

x = 2500 # pixel x-centre of cutout, must be an integer
y = 2500 # pixel y-centre of cutout, must be an integer
r = 100 # width/2 of cutout, must be int

sci = sci[x-r:x+r, y-r:y+r] # cutout a portion of the science image
wht = wht[x-r:x+r, y-r:y+r] # cutout a portion of the weight image

# --- define the noise in each pixel and make a significance map (signal/noise)

noise = 1./np.sqrt(wht) #Â conversion from weight to noise
sig = sci/noise # signifance map



# --- now run segmentation on the image.

from photutils import detect_sources
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt


threshold = 2.5 # require each pixel have a significance of >2.5 (since we're using the significance image)
npixels = 5 # require at least 5 connected pixels

segm = detect_sources(sig, threshold, npixels=npixels) # make segmentation image


# ---

unique, counts = np.unique(segm.data, return_counts=True)

print(unique)
print(counts)






# --- let's now plot the segmentation map but only for a single source

# segm.data is the segmentation map. In this map pixels are labelled as either "0" if they are part of the background (i.e. not associated with a source) or >0 if they belong to a source. Each discrete object has a different number.

# i = 11 # this corresponds to the 11th object NOT the 12th. The 0 (zero) index corresponds to the background. The choice of object 11 is completely arbitrary.


import random
i = random.randint(1, segm.nlabels) # choose a random object


masked_segm = np.ma.masked_where(segm.data != i, segm) # mask all pixels except object i

plt.imshow(masked_segm, cmap = 'rainbow') # plot masked segmentation map
plt.show()

# --- let's now plot the science (flux) map but only for the same single source

masked_sci = np.ma.masked_where(segm.data != i, sci)

plt.imshow(masked_sci, cmap = 'rainbow') # plot masked segmentation map
plt.show()


# --- instead of plotting the entire image we can plot a zoom in of the object we want. To do this we can use the slice provided by segmentation object

slices = segm.slices[i-1] # a pair of python slice objects NOTE: the -1 is necessary as slices are only provided for objects not the background. The first object would be segm.slices[0] NOT segm.slices[1] because of python indexing convention. BE CAREFUL.

plt.imshow(sci[slices], cmap = 'bone') # apply slice to science image
plt.show()


# --- now lets determine the total flux of that same source by simply summing the pixels

# we could simply sum the masked science image (masked_sci):

print(f'signal using masked science image: {np.sum(masked_sci)}')

# or, avoiding previous steps only sum pixels on the orginal science image where the segmentation map = the index of our target galaxy:

print(f'signal using science image + np.where command on segmentation map: {np.sum(sci[np.where(segm.data==i)])}')
